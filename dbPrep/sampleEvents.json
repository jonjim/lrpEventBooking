      "icInvitation": "<p>Fellow Dragons and friends from other nations! As we come to the end of the turn of another year you are cordially invited to BallyClare this solstice to celebrate our victories and mourn our losses. We shall sing songs, tell tales, play games and rebuild broken bridges, speak of issues ongoing in our lands, and bend the ear of our new Queen of the Dragons. All living and magical patterns are welcome, regardless of age. Regretfully, unliving patterns remain uninvited on Dragon lands. While under our hospitality, we aim to ensure your safety from outside forces. Thorkin Steward of Erin and Cymria</p>",

Loyal Gryphons and stalwart allies I call upon you to gather on the eve of the 18th day of the 11th month to ensure the opportunity our Legion has created is not wasted. To strike at the core of this threat and see it eradicated from the face of the Erdreja, and for the good of all upon the egg. We meet in Khaz Kurack in Lyonesse All For One!</p>",
