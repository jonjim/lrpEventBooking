Recently though trade caravans from the isolated port have been few and far between with claims of a bad season with even rougher seas than normal and ferocious storms which&nbsp;many boats have not survived.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>With rumours of&nbsp;horrific fish monsters walking the streets of the town&nbsp;even fewer caravans are willing to even attempt the journey and if it is not supplied his last port will fail.&nbsp;&nbsp;Admiral Junta Derrin, the leader of this hardy community of fisherman&nbsp;has sent a request to the King of Lugate asking him to send the strongest knights and magus he can spare&nbsp;to quell these storms and debunk these rumours so that trade can continue and this last access to the sea will not be lost.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>The Lugate King has spoken with the Brazene, Hutar and even the Norn and they have all agreed to &nbsp;send the most experienced of their heroes to secure this isolated but critical bastion.</em></p>",
