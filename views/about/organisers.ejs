                    <p>There is no denying that the root of Live Role Play is as a community hobby. Most trace back to university and gaming groups that wanted to branch away from the traditional table top gaming.</p>
                    <p>In recent years that ideal has shifted slightly and now a large number of highly successful commercial event organisers make it difficult (not deliberately) for smaller systems to compete. So we wanted to bring back that age old mantra used by so many; <i>"By Live Role Players, For Live Role Players"</i></p>
                    <p>One of the largest hurdles faced by LRP Event Organisers is the logistics of getting attendees to their events, whilst ensuring that all the necessary protections to their privacy can be met. To solve this problem, we have created something tailor made to LRP Event Organisers. Giving access to only the data required for their event, as well as streamlining the booking and payment process.</p>

                        <h5>What features exist for Event Organisers?</h5>
                        <p>As a brief overview, an Event Organiser can register their Event System (they may also register individaul hosts - such as a particular nation may be hosting the event), and create their events to be advertised and booked on the system. Here we will go into the details.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Advertise your event with no commitment to use the booking features</li>
                            <li>Varying Admin rights, allowing you to control which users can create events for your system or individual hosts</li>

                            <li><em>Or,</em> allow bookings from an external website</li>
                            <li>Optionally allow automatic bookings of meal tickets and bunks</li>
                            <li>Creation of manual bookings to consolidate your booking information into one place</li>
                            <li>Financial reports: adding key information about your event allows you to see breakeven points at a glance</li>
                            <li>Streamlined payment through PayPal</li>
                            <li>Seperate PDF Event Reports: for your event attendees, medical notes, and dietary notes.</li>
                            <li>Automated PDF Event Pack generation and e-mail</li>
                            <li>Bulk e-mail features to securely contact your event attendees</li>
                            <li>Option for recording character and player details, or even adding character progression*</li>
                            <li>All data stored and processed within the United Kingdom, complying with GDPR regulations.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <small>*Some features may require additional work which we may have to charge for depending on how translatable they are to other event systems.</small>

                        <h5>How do I register as an Event Organiser?</h5>
                        <p>We haven't entirely designed this part yet. The current aim is to run this system as donation only with no required costs to event organisers, but time will tell if that is financially viable. We hope so, as the aim is to keep this as community based to benefit the largets number of small LARP systems that keep this hobby alive.</p>
                        <p>Whilst we work out the financial implications and setup automatic registration we would still love to have your event system involed!</p>
                        <p>Please <a href="mailto:<%= config.techContactEmail %>?subject=Event System Registration&body=Hi, I would like to add my Event System to the booking website!">E-Mail <%= config.techContactName %></a> to express your interest.</p>
                        <h5>What are the downsides?</h5>
                        <p>This is an obvious concern. If you're going to use this system, what are the potential risks to your system?</p>
                        <p><b>PayPal</b> is a double edged sword. It's convenient and friendly to use, it does however charge for transactions. Some organisers encourage their attendees to pay via <em>"Friends and Family"</em> however this removes any buyer protection for the attendee. As such, we've decided this is the safest solution all round, despite the costs.</p> 
                        <p><b>A Shared Space</b> again has its pro's and con's. Whilst giving you increased exposure to new audiences, it also mean's your events may face new competition from other events. It is our sincere hope that overall this proves to be beneficial for the hobby.</p>
